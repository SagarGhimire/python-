#  Evaluation


## Milestone 2 (40/40 pts)

1. Create Notebook classification
* Data section (5)
* Markdown on feature choice and explanation (5)
* Decision tree (5)
* Metrics computed (5)
* Markdown commments (2/5)
* Try another classifier (5)
* Evaluation on test set (5)
* Markdown discussion of the results (5)
2. Updated the README

You need graphs to help present the results.

You may want to try some of the better classfiers on this data set.  

In your final results you may want to focus on how much each factor contributes to the results.  May also want to see if there is connection/correlation between high in math vs high in verbal.
